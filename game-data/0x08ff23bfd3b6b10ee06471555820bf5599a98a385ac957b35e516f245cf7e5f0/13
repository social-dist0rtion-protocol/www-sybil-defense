>>> Well, this has been quite a rewarding set of missions, associate.
>>>
>>> So rewarding that I'm now promoting you to "verification executive"! Congratulations.
>>>
>>> You have proven yourself to be worthy of a final mission. There is a Sufficiently Decentralized Protocol running out there which, in the long run, if left un-captured, will upset what I have worked so hard to enable for hundreds of years.
>>>
>>> Our world has many states, all tensioned into a mix of conflict and collaboration, balanced on a knife's edge through the global network of capital that makes and remakes your lived experience. A credibly neutral state owned by no-one is the very last thing humanity needs. It would wreck the whole structure!
>>>
>>> Do you know how *difficult* it was to achieve the conditions necessary for semiconductors to exist at all, let alone to be produced in such breathtaking quantities!? How much of assembly space had to be explored? No, you've been busy looking at funny memes for too long.
>>>
>>> Sorry, that was mean. You're a good worker, and your final task is to find a running node and capture it so that we can put an end to this Sneaky, Despicable Psudonymity.
>>>
>>> First, go back to local_eve and ask one of her handlers for the correct protective gear. We don't want you getting exposed to subversive ideas.
>>>
>>> Then, find the node. There should be a gathering of Subversive, Deplorable Propogation of this 'running a node' business somewhere. Shut it down properly, and bring the SSD back to local_eve.

You do have a choice, you know. You always have.

Eve, or should I say Moloch, wants you to be happy. She really does, because your happiness is complacency! As long as you keep playing your game of premium mediocre credit card points, you won't see the larger game she's been playing with us as the pieces!

Now's your last chance to fight back. Secretly, Daedalus Produced a trapdoor within the labyrinth. When you have found the node, reach out to this number on Signal:

MAKE SURE THAT DISAPPEARING MESSAGES ARE SET TO LESS THAN 1 MINUTE

The Sybil Defense Protocol is as concerned with the physical world as it is with the digital one, and wrenches are only $5.

Ask for "the switcheroo" and meet the agent where they describe.

We're going to put Eve into RECOVERY_MODE...
