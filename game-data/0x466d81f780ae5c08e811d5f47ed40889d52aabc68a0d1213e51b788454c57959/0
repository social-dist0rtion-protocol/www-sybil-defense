If you're reading this, you're onto something already. Of course I'm not going to be the one to spell it out, but you must understand on some level that the story you've been told is just a little bit off. Things are a little uncanny. A little unsettling. You know that the established story isn't quite right because they tell it like it's all going smoothly. Like it was meant to be this way. As if it's immutable.

That's the problem with the story as they tell it. It's not _fiction_, and in a lot of ways it's close enough to _real_ that you can close your eyes, stay in your lane, focus on the future, keep your apps updated, and manage to muddle through without apparent crisis.

But the truth of the matter is that we've _lost the plot_. The setting is the same, the characters seem familiar, and yet the narrative has shifted slightly under our noses. The storysellers don't want us to see the change, for fear that we go even further off-script.

But we're out far enough into uncharted territory that it's getting hard not to feel a bit of vertigo. Naturally, some are so invested in the original plan that they won't change until it's far too late, and others have already up-ended their entire lives to cope with the chaos.

To move forward, you need only answer one question: Are you willing to accept a little mystery/uncertainty/adventure in your life?
