Iris the Informatician has been asked to interpet the results of a chess tournament, in which A, B, C, D, and E all participated.

Everyone played competitively, such that the judges could not declare a winner.
You must discover a more advanced technique to determine the final ranking of the players.

Ten games were played in the tournament, with the following results:

```

A, B, and D played in a 3-game cycle

D, C, and A played in a 3-game cycle

B, A, and E played in a 3-game cycle

B beat C
```
