>>> Last year, before everything went pear-shaped, there was a chess tournament in which Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diego, and Eve (virtually) participated.
>>>
>>> Everyone played so competitively that no-one could declare a winner. In this ambiguity, nefarious forces went to work.
>>>
>>> You must deploy a more advanced technique to clarify the result, and restore balance to the force.
>>>
>>> Ten matches were played, with the following results:
>>>
>>> Alice beat Bob beat Diego beat Alice in a 3-game cycle
>>> Diego beat Charlie beat Alice beat Diego in a 3-game cycle
>>> Bob beat Alice beat Eve beat Bob in a 3-game cycle
>>> Bob beat Charlie
>>>
>>> Turn these results into a ranked ordering... somehow.
>>> Iris the Informatician may be able to help.
