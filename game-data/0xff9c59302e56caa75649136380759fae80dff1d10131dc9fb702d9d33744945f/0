If you're reading this, you're onto something already. Of course I'm not going to be the one to spell it out, but you must understand on some level that the story you've been told is just a little bit off. Uncanny and a little unsettling, and yet a little too smooth. Like it was meant to be this way. As if it's immutable.

The problem? It's not quite fiction, and in a lot of ways it's close enough to real that you can close your eyes, stay in your lane, focus on the future, keep your apps updated, and manage to muddle through without obvious crisis.

But the truth is that we've lost the plot. The setting is the same, the characters seem familiar, and yet the narrative has shifted under our noses. The storysellers don't want us to see the change, for fear that we try to go off-script.

> "The future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed yet."

-- William Gibson

Few people take this quote literally. It's a warning.

But we're out far enough into uncharted territory that it's getting hard not to feel a bit of vertigo.

To move forward, you need only **answer one question**: Are you willing to accept a little mystery/uncertainty/adventure in your life?
